This is the official implementation of our work: Temporal Diversity-Aware Micro-Video Recommendation with Long- and short-Term Interests Modeling.  The code has been tested under a Linux desktop with TensorFlow 1.13.1 and Python 3.6.2. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/12Zookq_qh6RtwahU7G_13w (code: 0109). Please note that "dataset2" refers to MicroVideo-1.7M, while "dataset1" corresponds to Kuaishou-3.0M. 
Run the project using the command "sh run.sh".
